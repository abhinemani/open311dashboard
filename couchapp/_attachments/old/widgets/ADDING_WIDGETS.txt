## New Widgets ##

Widgets are inherited from a base, and then a widget type.  Look at
the Google Map Example: open311.widget.example-map-google.js

To add a new widget, create a new file that looks like:

js/open311.widget.type-purpose.js

Ensure that you are inheriting a widget type, and if not, make a new
one.  All base types in file named like the following:
js/open311.widget.base-type.js
